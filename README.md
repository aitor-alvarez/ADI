# ADI
Arabic Dialect Identification using intonation patterns and Hybrid BLSTM Resnets networks

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the model:

1. Pytorch
2. Torchaudio
3. Numpy


To run the model just execute python main.py


Data from intonation patterns extracted from the VarDial and MGB-3 test set is available at https://github.com/aitor-mir/adi-patterns
